**Summary:** BankingCorp collaborates with a payday loan company to use customer data for targeted marketing, without public disclosure.

- Could exploit vulnerable individuals and lead to further financial difficulties for them because the marketing could reach customers who are already struggling financially.
- Lack of transparency regarding the partnership with the payday loan company and the use of customer data raises concerns about trust and customer privacy.

**What could the company do to address these issues?**
- Ensure full transparency by informing customers about the partnership with the payday loan company and how their data will be used.
- Obtain consent from customers before sharing their data with third parties for marketing purposes.
